                                                Explanation:<br>A: Customers should be able to adopt business applications from Microsoft and expect they speak the same language and seamlessly work together. Dual Write allows our customers to not think about these apps as different systems to write to independently; rather, the underlying infrastructure makes it seamless for these apps to write simultaneously.<br>D: Use Custom APIs to create your own APIs in Dataverse. With a Custom API you can consolidate a group of operations into an API that you and other developers can call in their code. The Dataverse connector enables calling Custom APIs actions in Power Automate.<br>E: Dataverse provides access to the environment database on the Microsoft Dataverse Service.

                                                Explanation:<br>User and team management is the area of Microsoft Dataverse where you can create and maintain user accounts and profiles.<br>A user is any person who works for a business unit who uses Dataverse. Each user has a user account.<br>A team is a group of users. Teams let users across an organization collaborate and share information.<br>Note: Why use Dataverse?<br>✑ Easy to secure ג€" Data is securely stored so that users can see it only if you grant them access. Role-based security allows you to control access to tables for different users within your organization.<br>✑ Data from your Dynamics 365 applications is also stored within Dataverse, allowing you to quickly build apps that use your Dynamics 365 data and extend your apps with Power Apps.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/user-team-entities https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro<br>

For example, you might have a Teachers table and a Class table, and the Class table might have a lookup relation to the Teachers table to show which teacher teaches the class. You can use a lookup column to show data from the Teachers table.<br>This is commonly referred to as a lookup column.<br>The LookUp function finds the first record in a table that satisfies a formula. Use LookUp to find a single record that matches one or more criteria. For both, the formula is evaluated for each record of the table<br><br>Box 2: Choices -<br>You can customize forms (main, quick create, and quick view) and email templates by adding multi-select columns that are called Choices. When you add a choices column, you can specify multiple values that will be available for users to select.

                                                Explanation:<br>A: When you share a dashboard or report, the people you share it with can view it and interact with it, but can't edit it. They see the same data that you see in the dashboard and reports and get access to the entire underlying dataset unless row-level security (RLS) is applied to the underlying dataset.<br>B: Depending on the sensitivity of an organization's data, it is often necessary to disable the ability to export or print reports.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-share-dashboards<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>A: Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft. It aims to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards. It is part of the Microsoft Power Platform.<br>D: Power BI Apps are an easy way for designers to share different types of content at one time. App designers create the dashboards and reports and bundle them together into an app. The designers then share or publish the app to a location where you, the business user, can access it. Because related dashboards and reports are bundled together, it's easier for you to find and install in both the Power BI service (https://powerbi.com) and on your mobile device. After you install an app, you don't have to remember the names of a lot of different dashboards or reports because they're all together in one app, in your browser or on your mobile device.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/consumer/end-user-apps<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>You can help ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time they work with a customer by creating a business process flow. For example, you might want to create a business process flow to have everyone handle customer service requests the same way, or to require that people get approval for an invoice before submitting an order. Business process flows use the same underlying technology as other processes, but the capabilities that they provide are very different from other features that use processes.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/business-process-flows-overview<br>

                                                Explanation:<br><br>Box 1: Azure Service Bus -<br>Post requests to a system that is not always available and limited in its ability to process high volumes of messages.<br>Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics (in a namespace). Service Bus is used to decouple applications and services from each other, providing the following benefits:<br>Load-balancing work across competing workers<br>Safely routing and transferring data and control across service and application boundaries<br>Coordinating transactional work that requires a high-degree of reliability<br><br>Box 2: Azure Relay -<br>Allow peer-to-peer communication between on-premises services and cloud-based model-driven Microsoft Power Platform apps.<br>The Azure Relay service enables you to securely expose services that run in your corporate network to the public cloud. You can do so without opening a port on your firewall, or making intrusive changes to your corporate network infrastructure.<br>The relay service supports the following scenarios between on-premises services and applications running in the cloud or in another on-premises environment.<br>Traditional one-way, request/response, and peer-to-peer communication<br>Event distribution at internet-scope to enable publish/subscribe scenarios<br>Bi-directional and unbuffered socket communication across network boundaries<br><br>Box 3: Azure Event hub -<br>Stream large volumes of data from the companyג€™s website to a live Power BI dashboard.<br>Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service thatג€™s simple, trusted, and scalable. Stream millions of events per second from any source to build dynamic data pipelines and immediately respond to business challenges.<br><br>Box 4: Azure Functions -<br>Support enterprise-level integrations with Dynamics 365 that can be billed on a consumption basis.<br>One of three Azure Functions billings option is completely serverless, with the consumption plan based on resources consumed and number of executions.<br>Incorrect:<br>Logic Apps has a pure pay-per-usage billing model. You pay for each action that gets executed.

Workers must be able to enter any additional information that is required by or may be helpful to recruiters.<br> The solution must provide workers a way to search for general information about available positions.<br> Workers must be able to request copies of their records by using a chatbot. Workers must be able to provide information to a recruiter as needed.<br><br>Data platform -<br> Audit teams must have the ability to view worker information on their mobile devices.<br> Audit teams must be able to record data during visits to locations where workers are placed.<br> The solution must support the ability for a corporate governance auditing team to periodically audit the organizationג€™s records, policies, and procedures.<br><br>Reporting and analytics -<br> The reporting and analytics team must be able to create reports that include data from all facilities and all workers.<br> Management reports must present an overview of the entire organization. Other reports may be limited to specific offices.<br> You must create dashboards that show the status across all groups of workers. The dashboards must be embedded into the Power Platform apps. Updates to data must be displayed in near real time.<br><br>Security -<br> Authentication for all user types must be managed by a single platform. IT teams must use PowerShell to apply security permissions for users.<br> Worker records must only be viewed by the recruiting office that the worker visits.<br> Worker skill records must be archived after ten years and are then removed from the main system. Worker information must not be deleted from the system while skill and job placement history records for the worker exist in the system.<br> User security roles must be customized to ensure that users are able to interact only with the specific data in which they need access.<br> Workers must be able to sign into a portal by using their own email address. Workers must be required to use a secure method of authentication to be able to view their data.<br> Alerts regarding the number of recruited and placed at client companies must be updated as background processes.<br><br>Issues -<br>The organization reports the following issues:<br> Recruiters report that they cannot see historical job placement data for workers.<br> API usage reports show that the number of API calls made exceeds limits. This causes delays saving data.<br> Users cannot view Power BI reports within the Power Platform apps.<br> Some security clearance information for workers not visible from within the Power Platform solution.<br> Audit teams report that they cannot view or edit worker data when the device on which they access the solution does not have network connectivity.<br>The testing team reports that one of the canvas apps is not working as expected.

                                                Explanation:<br>Box 1: Omnichannel for Customer Service dashboard<br>Scenario: Workers must be able to communicate in near real-time with worker support agents.<br>The company has a team or worker support agents that respond to inquiries from current and prospective workers. Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br>If you choose to expand your customer service offering to provide chat and channels, the Customer Service workspace seamlessly adjusts to support managing conversations as well.<br>Note: As an agent with the Customer Service Representative security role, when you open Customer Service workspace, you start on the Customer Service Agent<br>Dashboard unless your administrator has changed the default view. This dashboard shows you your active cases, cases you can work in queues you are assigned to, and your open activities. You can open existing cases and activities or begin working new cases from the queues you are assigned to and create activities.<br>Box 2: Dynamics 365 Customer Service<br>Scenario: First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-service/csw-overview<br>

The company operates offices in multiple countries/regions.<br>First Up has both full-time and part-time employees. The company has a team or worker support agents that respond to inquiries from current and prospective workers. Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br>The company does not have a standardized tool used for reporting purposes. The organization engages you to implement a new Power Platform solution.<br>Workers are managed by a dedicated team that includes one primary recruiter and a contract assistant. Many client companies live in areas that do not allow for mobile data connections.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Existing systems and processes -<br> First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br> The company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br> Employee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Azure Active Directory.<br>An appointment record is created for each visit with a worker. The record includes worker contact information, preferred language, the date and time of the<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-56_4.png" alt=""></div> appointment, and other relevant data. This information is reviewed by the workerג€™s primary recruiter.<br> First Up has no current capabilities for forecasting future worker needs based on the data held.<br><br>Client company visits -<br>Before First Up signs a contract to place workers at a client company, a member of the audit team visits the company and interviews company management. Audit members use different types of devices including Android and iOS devices. First Up has no plans to require the use of a single type of device. Audit team members currently record information about workers on paper forms. Team members enter information from paper forms into the system when they return to the office.<br>First Up audits client companies at least once each year but may schedule additional visits based on feedback from workers that they place at a client company.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General -<br> There is no standardized communication tool across the company, and this causes communication issues between different teams.<br> First up employees must be able to contact each other by using a secure system to ask and answer questions about jobs and potential workers.<br> Workers must be able to communicate in near real-time with worker support agents.<br> You must minimize development and administrative effort required to implement the solution.<br><br>Client company visits -<br> Audit team records must be locked after they have been reviewed by a First Up manager. No further edits to the record can be carried out. This must be implemented using standard available system functionality.<br> Audit teams must be able to enter records of their visits to the companies where they have or may place workers. Audit teams must be able to update any necessary records with the latest information.<br> The solution must support tracking of security clearance information for a worker including the date, status, and certifying agency.<br> When a worker makes an appointment, the appointments must appear in the timeline for the workerג€™s contact record.<br><br>Job history information -<br> The solution must provide a worker appointment booking system that can access worker historical job placement data.<br> The solution must allow employees to associate a primary recruiter with each worker. The solution must also allow multiple secondary recruiters to be associated with each worker.<br> Every worker assessment performed must be validated and countersigned by the primary recruiter for a worker.<br> Job posting data from previous work engagements must be accessible by the Power Platform solution to ensure that new job postings are accurate.<br> First Up staff members must be able to view and update worker records. They must be able to see current and historical job placement data on the same form in the new solution.<br><br>Worker access -<br> The solution must support workers that speak different languages. The solution must provide automatic translation capabilities.<br> The solution must support near real-time communications between workers and recruiters.<br> Workers must be able to view their records online. Workers must be able to enter any additional information that is required by or may be helpful to recruiters.<br> The solution must provide workers a way to search for general information about available positions.<br> Workers must be able to request copies of their records by using a chatbot. Workers must be able to provide information to a recruiter as needed.<br><br>Data platform -<br> Audit teams must have the ability to view worker information on their mobile devices.<br> Audit teams must be able to record data during visits to locations where workers are placed.<br> The solution must support the ability for a corporate governance auditing team to periodically audit the organizationג€™s records, policies, and procedures.<br><br>Reporting and analytics -<br> The reporting and analytics team must be able to create reports that include data from all facilities and all workers.<br> Management reports must present an overview of the entire organization. Other reports may be limited to specific offices.<br> You must create dashboards that show the status across all groups of workers. The dashboards must be embedded into the Power Platform apps. Updates to data must be displayed in near real time.<br><br>Security -<br> Authentication for all user types must be managed by a single platform. IT teams must use PowerShell to apply security permissions for users.<br> Worker records must only be viewed by the recruiting office that the worker visits.<br> Worker skill records must be archived after ten years and are then removed from the main system. Worker information must not be deleted from the system while skill and job placement history records for the worker exist in the system.<br> User security roles must be customized to ensure that users are able to interact only with the specific data in which they need access.<br> Workers must be able to sign into a portal by using their own email address. Workers must be required to use a secure method of authentication to be able to view their data.<br> Alerts regarding the number of recruited and placed at client companies must be updated as background processes.<br><br>Issues -<br>The organization reports the following issues:<br> Recruiters report that they cannot see historical job placement data for workers.<br> API usage reports show that the number of API calls made exceeds limits. This causes delays saving data.<br> Users cannot view Power BI reports within the Power Platform apps.<br> Some security clearance information for workers not visible from within the Power Platform solution.<br> Audit teams report that they cannot view or edit worker data when the device on which they access the solution does not have network connectivity.<br>The testing team reports that one of the canvas apps is not working as expected.

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-74_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists.

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-74_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br><br>HOTSPOT -<br>You need to recommend components to meet the re-inspection requirements.<br>Which components should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>Hot Area:<br><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-77_1.jpg" alt=""></div><br>

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-74_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br>You need to recommend a method for transferring machine information to Dynamics 365 Field Service.<br>What should you recommend?<br>

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-74_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br>You need to recommend a solution to collect the information required to meet reporting requirements.<br>What should you recommend?<br>

Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-74_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br><br>HOTSPOT -<br>You need to recommend solutions to meet the inspection requirements.<br>What should you recommend?

It's recommended that you download an Excel template, add your data, and then import the file to your app. The template saves time and effort. Don't add or modify columns in the template to avoid issues during the import.<br>Note:<br>Step 1: Download an Excel template<br>To avoid mapping issue, it's recommended that you use an Excel template that you can download from your app. Once the template is downloaded add your data and then import the file back to your app. Remember don't add or modify columns in the template to avoid issues during the import process.<br><br>Step 2: Import your data -<br>Use the template that you downloaded in the previous step (modified with your data) and import the file to your app.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/user/import-data<br>

For example, if an entity permission allows Read access to Lead entity with the Account scope, the user having this permission can view all the leads of only the parent account of the user.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>Self Scope allows you to define the rights a user has to their own Contact (Identity) record. Users can use entity forms or web forms to make changes to their own<br>Contact record linked with their profile.<br>Parental scope: In this most complex case, permissions are granted for an entity that is a relationship away from an entity for which an Entity Permission record has already been defined. This permission is actually a child record of the parent entity permission.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/assign-entity-permissions<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>Box 1: Data loss prevention policy<br>Data loss prevention (DLP) policies enforce rules for which connectors can be used together by classifying connectors as either Business or Non-Business. If you put a connector in the Business group, it can only be used with other connectors from that group in any given app or flow.

                                                Explanation:<br>B: Setting a column to Business Required means that the default behavior of a model-driven or canvas app will enforce this requirement in the app.<br>C: With alternate keys you can now define a column in a Dataverse table to correspond to a unique identifier (or unique combination of columns) used by the external data store. This alternate key can be used to uniquely identify a record in Dataverse in place of the primary key. You must be able to define which columns represent a unique identity for your records. Once you identify the columns that are unique to the table, you can declare them as alternate keys through the customization user interface (UI) or in the code.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-field-portal https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/define-alternate-keys-entity<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>With the position hierarchy security, a user at a higher position has access to the records owned by a lower position user or by the team that a user is a member of, and to the records that are directly shared to the user or the team that a user is a member of.<br>The hierarchy security model is an extension to the earlier security models that use business units, security roles, sharing, and teams.

For example, split a full name that is contained in the source file into a first name and a last name to match the target columns for a table.<br>Note:<br>To implement data import, you typically do the following:<br>✑ Create a comma-separated values (CSV), XML Spreadsheet 2003 (XMLSS), or text source file.<br>✑ Create a data map or use an existing data map.<br>✑ Create a comma-separated values (CSV), XML Spreadsheet 2003 (XMLSS), or text source file.<br>✑ Create a data map or use an existing data map.<br>✑ Associate an import file with a data map.<br>✑ Upload the content from a source file to the associated import file.<br>✑ Parse the import file.<br>✑ Transform the parsed data.<br>✑ Upload the transformed data into the target Dataverse server.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/import-data https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/add-transformation-mappings-import<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>A: With advanced data preparation available in Power Apps, you can create a collection of data called a dataflow, which you can then use to connect with business data from various sources, clean the data, transform it, and then load it to Microsoft Dataverse or your organizationג€™s Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage account.<br>B: By combining conditions and actions, you can do any of the following with business rules:<br>✑ Set column values<br>✑ Clear column values<br>✑ Set column requirement levels<br>✑ Show or hide columns<br>✑ Enable or disable columns<br>✑ Validate data and show error messages<br>✑ Create business recommendations based on business intelligence.<br>C: Duplicate detection works by comparing generated match codes of existing records with each new record being created. These match codes are created as each new record is created. Therefore, there is potential for one or more duplicate records to be created if they are processed at the exact same moment. In addition to detecting duplicates as they are created, you should schedule duplicate detection jobs to check for other potential duplicate records.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-create-business-rule https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-and-use-dataflows https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/duplicaterule-entities<br>

                                                Explanation:<br><br>Box 1: Use Virtual tables -<br>A virtual entity is a custom entity in Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) that has fields containing data from an external data source. Virtual entities appear in your app to users as regular entity records, but contain data that is sourced from an external database, such as an Azure SQL Database.<br>Records based on virtual entities are available in all clients including custom clients developed using the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Web Services.<br>Box 2: Use Dynamics 365 Web API.<br>Dynamics 365 Web Services API: Many times, straight database-to-database integrations arenג€™t a possibility.

                                                Explanation:<br><br>Box 1: Field security profile -<br>Record-level permissions are granted at the entity level, but you may have certain fields associated with an entity that contain data that is more sensitive than the other fields. For these situations, you use field-level security to control access to specific fields.<br>Field-level security is available for the default fields on most out-of-box entities, custom fields, and custom fields on custom entities. Field-level security is managed by the security profiles.<br><br>Box 2: Compliancy policy -<br>Compliance policy settings ג€" Tenant-wide settings that are like a built-in compliance policy that every device receives. Compliance policy settings set a baseline for how compliance policy works in your Intune environment, including whether devices that havenג€™t received any device compliance policies are compliant or noncompliant.<br>Note: Mobile device management (MDM) solutions like Intune can help protect organizational data by requiring users and devices to meet some requirements. In<br>Intune, this feature is called compliance policies.<br>Compliance policies in Intune:<br>Define the rules and settings that users and devices must meet to be compliant.<br>Include actions that apply to devices that are noncompliant.

A user's privileges can come from their individual security roles, those of the teams that they're part of or the ones they inherit. A team has full access rights on the records that the team owns. Team members are added manually to the owner team.<br><br>Box 2: Access team -<br>Access team: An access team doesn't own records and doesn't have security roles assigned to the team. The team members have privileges defined by their individual security roles and by roles from the teams they're members of. These members share records with an access team, and the team is granted access rights to the records.

                                                Explanation:<br>B: We need is a source for exchange rates. There are some published connectors, but you also use a free service called Exchange Rates API, which are based on the European Central Bank, and create a custom connection.<br>Now that we have our custom connector defined and have a way to request the latest exchange rates, the next step is to create a Power Automate flow that will update all of currencies setup in our Dataverse environment.<br>Dataverse is a multicurrency system, in which each record can be associated with its own currency. This currency is called the transaction currency. The multicurrency features enable users to perform financial transactions like opportunities, quotes, orders, and invoices in multiple currencies. This feature also provides a currency choice to the end user when a financial transaction occurs.<br>Reference:<br>https://readyxrm.blog/2021/03/10/updating-currency-exchange-rates-in-dataverse/<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>A virtual table is a custom table in Microsoft Dataverse that has columns containing data from an external data source. Virtual tables appear in your app to users as regular table rows, but contain data that is sourced from an external database, such as an Azure SQL Database. Rows based on virtual tables are available in all clients including custom clients developed using the Dataverse web services.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>D: The On-premises data gateway provides secure data transfer between on-premises data sources and your Azure Analysis Services servers in the cloud.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities<br>

                                            A local bank uses Microsoft Power Platform apps to store customer data.<br>The bank IT director discovers that all employees can see the social security numbers of their customers. The IT team does not understand how field-level security works and needs help with the design.<br>You need to recommend a solution to the bank that meets the following requirements:<br>✑ The system must restrict access to customer social security numbers to the vice president of finance only.<br>✑ The vice president of finance must be able to read and update customer social security numbers.<br>Which two actions should you recommend? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>Field-level security is managed by the security profiles.

Actions taken on the parent row will not be applied to the child row, but the parent row cannot be deleted while the child row exists. This is useful if you do not want child rows to become orphaned. This forces the user to delete all of the children before deleting the parent.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-entity-lookup<br>

The company operates offices in multiple countries/regions.<br>First Up has both full-time and part-time employees. The company has a team or worker support agents that respond to inquiries from current and prospective workers. Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br>The company does not have a standardized tool used for reporting purposes. The organization engages you to implement a new Power Platform solution.<br>Workers are managed by a dedicated team that includes one primary recruiter and a contract assistant. Many client companies live in areas that do not allow for mobile data connections.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Existing systems and processes -<br> First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br> The company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br> Employee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Azure Active Directory.<br>An appointment record is created for each visit with a worker. The record includes worker contact information, preferred language, the date and time of the<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-139_4.png" alt=""></div> appointment, and other relevant data. This information is reviewed by the workerג€™s primary recruiter.<br> First Up has no current capabilities for forecasting future worker needs based on the data held.<br><br>Client company visits -<br>Before First Up signs a contract to place workers at a client company, a member of the audit team visits the company and interviews company management. Audit members use different types of devices including Android and iOS devices. First Up has no plans to require the use of a single type of device.

                                                Explanation:<br>A virtual table is a custom table in Microsoft Dataverse that has columns containing data from an external data source. Virtual tables appear in your app to users as regular table rows, but contain data that is sourced from an external database, such as an Azure SQL Database. Rows based on virtual tables are available in all clients including custom clients developed using the Dataverse web services.<br>Scenario:<br>✑ First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br>✑ The company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br>✑ The solution must provide a worker appointment booking system that can access worker historical job placement data.<br>✑ First Up staff members must be able to view and update worker records.

                                                Explanation:<br><br>Box 1: Virtual Table -<br>A virtual table is a custom table in Microsoft Dataverse that has columns containing data from an external data source. Virtual tables appear in your app to users as regular table rows, but contain data that is sourced from an external database, such as an Azure SQL Database. Rows based on virtual tables are available in all clients including custom clients developed using the Dataverse web services.<br>Scenario:<br>✑ First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br>✑ The company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br>✑ The solution must provide a worker appointment booking system that can access worker historical job placement data.<br>✑ First Up staff members must be able to view and update worker records. They must be able to see current and historical job placement data on the same form in the new solution.<br>Box 2: Lookup (N:1)<br>Each worker can have many security clearances, so need a 1:N relationship.<br>Scenario: The solution must support tracking of security clearance information for a worker including the date, status, and certifying agency.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-virtual-entities https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/create-edit-entity-relationships<br>

The company operates offices in multiple countries/regions.<br>First Up has both full-time and part-time employees. The company has a team or worker support agents that respond to inquiries from current and prospective workers. Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br>The company does not have a standardized tool used for reporting purposes. The organization engages you to implement a new Power Platform solution.<br>Workers are managed by a dedicated team that includes one primary recruiter and a contract assistant. Many client companies live in areas that do not allow for mobile data connections.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Existing systems and processes -<br> First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br> The company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br> Employee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Azure Active Directory.<br>An appointment record is created for each visit with a worker. The record includes worker contact information, preferred language, the date and time of the<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-139_4.png" alt=""></div> appointment, and other relevant data. This information is reviewed by the workerג€™s primary recruiter.<br> First Up has no current capabilities for forecasting future worker needs based on the data held.<br><br>Client company visits -<br>Before First Up signs a contract to place workers at a client company, a member of the audit team visits the company and interviews company management.

The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br>The on-premises data gateway acts as a bridge to provide quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data (data that isn't in the cloud) and several<br>Microsoft cloud services. These cloud services include Power BI, PowerApps, Power Automate, Azure Analysis Services, and Azure Logic Apps.

                                                Explanation:<br>Box 1: Power Platform Local Business Owner Team<br>Owner team: An owner team owns records and has security roles assigned to the team. A user's privileges can come from their individual security roles, those of the teams that they're part of or the ones they inherit. A team has full access rights on the records that the team owns. Team members are added manually to the owner team.<br>Scenario: Employee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Azure Active Directory.<br>Box 2: Azure Active Directory Security Group Team<br>An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group team. Similar to owner team, an Azure AD group team can own records and can have security roles assigned to the team.<br>Note: The administration of app and data access for Microsoft Dataverse has been extended to allow administrators to use their organization's Azure Active<br>Directory (Azure AD) groups to manage access rights for licensed Dataverse users.<br>Box 3: Azure Active Directory B2B Guest Access<br>An Azure AD B2B collaboration user is an external user, typically from a partner organization, that you invite to sign into your Azure AD organization using their own credentials. This B2B collaboration user (also generally referred to as a guest user) can then access the apps and resources you want to share with them. A user object is created for the B2B collaboration user in the same directory as your employees. B2B collaboration user objects have limited privileges in your directory by default, and they can be managed like employees, added to groups, and so on.<br>Scenario: Before First Up signs a contract to place workers at a client company, a member of the audit team visits the company and interviews company management. Audit members use different types of devices including Android and iOS devices. First Up has no plans to require the use of a single type of device.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-group-teams https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/user-properties<br>

Activities also contain data that helps determine what action the activity represents, for example, subject and description.<br><br>Passenger: Customer table -<br>The account and contact tables in Microsoft Dataverse are essential for identifying and managing customers, selling products and services, and providing superior service to the customers. A customer address table is used to store address and shipping information for a customer.<br>Scenario: The company has a custom app for managing and tracking passenger luggage. The app uses Microsoft Dataverse.<br>Agents need to view which pieces of luggage match to each passenger, and then need to add the total on the passenger record.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>✑ A virtual table is a custom table in Dataverse that has columns containing data from an external data source.

                                                Explanation:<br>Scenario: Ensure that employees can sign in to all Microsoft apps by using one set of credentials per employee.<br>Synchronized identity. Synchronize on-premises directory objects with Microsoft 365 and manage your users on-premises. You can also synchronize passwords so that the users have the same password on-premises and in the cloud, but they will have to sign in again to use Microsoft 365.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>D: The benefit of federation is a single sign-on experience across Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises) and Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement<br>(on-premises) systems. This type of identity management is useful for large corporations that have hundreds or thousands of established users.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/manage-user-account-synchronization<br>

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-168_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br><br>HOTSPOT -<br>You need to recommend a solution to meet user interface requirements.<br>What should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>Hot Area:<br><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-170_1.png" alt=""></div><br>

                                                Explanation:<br>Box 1: Create and embed a Power Bi radial gauge<br>A radial gauge chart has a circular arc and shows a single value that measures progress toward a goal or a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). The line (or needle) represents the goal or target value. The shading represents the progress toward that goal. The value inside the arc represents the progress value. Power BI spreads all possible values evenly along the arc, from the minimum (left-most value) to the maximum (right-most value).<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-171_1.png" alt=""></div><br>In this example, you're a car retailer tracking the sales team's average sales per month. The needle represents a 140 cars sales goal. The minimum possible average sales is 0 and the maximum is 200. The blue shading shows that the team is averaging approximately 120 sales this month.<br>Box 2: Add an inspection order to the work order form<br>You can add inspections to work orders in Dynamics 365 Field Service.<br>Field Service inspections are digital forms that technicians use to quickly and easily answer a list of questions as part of a work order. The list of questions can include safety protocols, pass-and-fail tests for a customer asset, an interview with a customer, or other audits and assessments performed before, during, or after a work order.<br>Example:<br><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-172_1.jpg" alt=""></div><br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-radial-gauge-charts https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/field-service/inspections<br>

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges.

Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine.

The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-168_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br><br>HOTSPOT -<br>You need to design the quality inspection order data model.<br>What should you recommend?

                                                Explanation:<br>Box 1: Create a lookup to Dynamics 365 Field Service<br>Scenario: Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br>Entity lookup: Allows technicians to choose a Dynamics 365 record. In the inspection designer interface, admins must select an entity and a field to display. For a chosen entity, the Name field and mandatory fields are the entity attributes that can be displayed in the lookup.<br>Box 2: Create a one-to-many relationship and set the behavior to Parental<br>Scenario: Inspection orders must:<br>✑ Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>✑ Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>Each inspection order can have one or many inspection steps, and each inspection step has a rating.<br>Note: Each pair of tables that are eligible to have a 1:N relationship can have multiple 1:N relationships between them.

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-168_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br><br>HOTSPOT -<br>You need to recommend the appropriate components to meet the inspection requirements.<br>What should you recommend? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>Hot Area:<br><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-179_1.jpg" alt=""></div><br>

                                                Explanation:<br><br>Box 1: Security role -<br>Microsoft Dataverse uses a role-based security model to help secure access to the database.<br>Scenario:<br>✑ You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br>✑ Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br><br>Box 2: Data flow -<br>Dataflows are a self-service, cloud-based, data preparation technology. Dataflows enable customers to ingest, transform, and load data into Microsoft Dataverse environments, Power BI workspaces, or your organization's Azure Data Lake Storage account.<br>Scenario: Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/database-security https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/dataflows/overview-dataflows-across-power-platform-dynamics-365<br>

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-168_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br>You need to manage user access to the app.<br>Which two connection types should you recommend? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>

The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-168_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br>You need to resolve the issue reported during testing.<br>What should you do?<br>

The company installs and services the machines for customers.<br>Fabrikam has manufacturing plants in Canada, France, and China. The company also has regional service organizations that are responsible for installation and maintenance of the machines.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Overview -<br>Operations for the company are managed very informally. Only a small number of long-term employees are aware of all manufacturing processes. The company has been experiencing quality issues associated with its manufacturing operations and installations.<br>The company wants to implement a way to capture quality inspection results for each machine produced. Current inspection checklists are stored in the Files section of a Teams channel for inspectors. Inspectors commonly print the incorrect inspection checklist.<br>The company has specific inspection stations for certain inspection steps. Each station has the gauges and equipment required for related inspection steps. There is often a backlog at specific inspection stations. This results in delays in shipping machines to customers.<br><br>Accounting system -<br> The current system does not handle shop floor or manufacturing planning functionality.<br> Machines are assigned serial numbers and placed in stock until they are shipped to customers.<br> Employee information is maintained only within the accounting system. Access to the information is strictly controlled due to privacy regulations and company policies.<br><br>Other systems -<br> The company has an enterprise Microsoft 365 subscription. The company uses Microsoft 365 only for sending and receiving email. The company uses photos of employees to generate employee badges. Photos are uploaded into Microsoft 365 user profiles.<br> The company recently started using Dynamics 365 Field Service to manage and maintain the machines that it installs for its customers. The app has not been customized.<br> The company has added roles, skills, and certification proficiencies to Dynamics 365 Field Service resources to support both customer onsite inspections and final manufacturing inspections.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General requirements -<br> The solution must be able to provide a printed quality certificate that is included with each machine. The inspection certificate must contain the name of the customer that the machine is sold to before the certificate is finalized.<br> Information about each machine produced must be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service. The information must include machine specifications and maintenance requirements.<br> You must be able to reference inspection information and quality certification information from within Dynamics 365 Field Service. Technicians must be able to view referenced inspection information from the custom solution when they perform maintenance on machines.<br> Machine information must not be transferred to Dynamics 365 Field Service until the machine passes inspection and the inspection certificate is certified.<br><br>Quality inspection app -<br>Fabrikam is evaluating Microsoft Power Platform to determine whether it can meet the companyג€™s requirements for a manufacturing defect and quality inspection solution. Each machine produced must be subjected to a quality inspection at various points during production. Each machine must undergo a more extensive quality inspection before the machine can be shipped to the customer.<br><br>Inspection orders -<br> Inspection orders must:<br>- Allow entry of quality ratings of passed or failed for each quality metric identified for the machine being rated.<br>- Include information about the person who performed each inspection step and any comments made by the inspector.<br>- Be automatically marked as failed if one inspection step rating is marked as failed.<br>- Be automatically marked for re-inspection should a machine fail inspection. The new inspection order must be created by using the originating inspection order as a template.<br>Inspectors must fill in findings comments and upload at least one photo for any inspection step that is marked as failed.<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-168_12.png" alt=""></div><br><br>Inspection standardization -<br>Standardized checklists must be stored in the solution for use by inspectors. A copy must be created when a new inspection is initiated. The solution must:<br> Prevent an inspector from proceeding to the next step of the checklist until required information for a step is entered.<br> Support the addition of steps to inspections to support custom features added to a machine for a customer.<br> Support the direct input of measurements from testing gauges to avoid incorrect readings being entered by inspectors.<br> Provide a visual representation of the testing measurement limits for each step. Include an indication of how the measured value compares to measurement limits and whether the measurement is within tolerance. Users must be able to configure the visualizations to display the minimum value and maximum value, and whether the reading is within the tolerance of a single targeted value. It must also be able to be used for maintenance inspections once the machine has been installed.<br> Support the ability to store photo references within each inspection step to document defects found during inspections.<br><br>Security -<br> Users must be active employees of Fabrikam.<br> When a user signs into the inspection solution, the solution must display a picture of the employee who has signed in.<br> Supervisors must be able to modify standard checklists. Other employees must be prevented from modifying checklists.<br> You must prevent users from changing inspection order data once an inspection is marked as final.<br><br>Analytics and reporting -<br>The solution must:<br> Provide metrics including existing and upcoming demand by inspection station, average time spent per user at a station, and average time a machine spends at each inspection point.<br> Provide metrics per inspector including number of inspections performed by month, and number of inspections per rating type (pass, fail).<br> Provide a printed quality certificate to be included with each machine.<br><br>Issues -<br>During initial testing of the solution, testers report that they cannot see the photos taken during a previously failed inspection.<br><br>You need to recommend an environment for the inspection solution.<br>Where should you recommend installing the solution?<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>DLP policies enforce rules for which connectors can be used together by classifying connectors as either Business or Non-Business. If you put a connector in the<br>Business group, it can only be used with other connectors from that group in any given app or flow. Sometimes you might want to block the usage of certain connectors altogether by classifying them as Blocked.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>D: Controls that require extra data beyond the primary record produce the most strain on form responsiveness and loading speed. These controls fetch data over the network and often involve a waiting period (seen as progress indicators) because it can take time to transmit the data.<br>Keep only the most frequently used of these controls on the default tab.<br>Incorrect Answers:<br>B: Use asynchronous network requests when requesting data. Request data asynchronously rather than synchronously when extra data is necessary for customizations.<br>C: Moving scripts to the Onload event would slow down the loading of the form.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/design-performant-forms<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>A: To enable Logic Apps, Power Automate, or Power Apps to communicate with the REST or SOAP API, use a custom connector, which is a wrapper around a<br>REST API (Logic Apps also supports SOAP APIs).<br>C: Custom APIs are a powerful way to connect to any existing API, hosted anywhere, from PowerApps. You do not need a PowerApps Enterprise subscription to register or use a Custom API.<br>Custom APIs are RESTful endpoints that you can connect to and use from PowerApps. All youג€™ll need is a Swagger definition file for your endpoint.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/guidance/architecture/real-world-examples/custom-connector-canvas https://powerapps.microsoft.com/hr-hr/blog/register-and-use-custom-apis-in-powerapps/<br>

                                                Explanation:<br>A: Use a remote connection.<br>B: Hosted RPA bots (preview) allow you to run unattended automation at scale without the need to provide or setup any machine. Hosted RPA bots can be created like any other machine group and machines will be automatically provisioned by Power Automate based on the defined configuration. Desktop flows assigned to a group of hosted RPA bots will get queued to it when triggered to run. Like for any machine group, when a bot in the group is available, it will be assigned the next desktop flow to be executed in the queue.<br>Reference:<br>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/hosted-rpa-bots<br>

                                            You are a Microsoft Power Platform architect developing a solution for a car retailer. Your solution includes reference data that relates to car colors, car types, and car models. Automation has been developed and deployed to notify account managers based on the car color, car make, and car model selected by potential buyers.<br>Notifications are failing to send to account managers due to different record identifiers between environments.<br>You need to update the reference data across all environments.<br>What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.<br>NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.<br>

The company operates offices in multiple countries/regions.<br>First Up has both full-time and part-time employees. The company has a team or worker support agents that respond to inquiries from current and prospective workers. Some of the worker support agents are multilingual.<br>The company does not have a standardized tool used for reporting purposes. The organization engages you to implement a new Power Platform solution.<br>Workers are managed by a dedicated team that includes one primary recruiter and a contract assistant. Many client companies live in areas that do not allow for mobile data connections.<br><br>Current environment -<br><br>Existing systems and processes -<br> First Up uses an on-premises system to manage current and historical patient data including medications and medical visits.<br> The company plans to reference historical data in the existing system. The records held in these systems will not be migrated to the new solution except for medication information.<br> Employee authentication with the existing system is provided by an on-premises Active Directory instance that is linked to Azure Active Directory.<br>An appointment record is created for each visit with a worker. The record includes worker contact information, preferred language, the date and time of the<br></p><div class="image_container"><img src="./PL-600 Exam - Free Questions and Answers - ITExams.com_files/xmlfile-202_4.png" alt=""></div> appointment, and other relevant data. This information is reviewed by the workerג€™s primary recruiter.<br> First Up has no current capabilities for forecasting future worker needs based on the data held.<br><br>Client company visits -<br>Before First Up signs a contract to place workers at a client company, a member of the audit team visits the company and interviews company management. Audit members use different types of devices including Android and iOS devices. First Up has no plans to require the use of a single type of device. Audit team members currently record information about workers on paper forms. Team members enter information from paper forms into the system when they return to the office.<br>First Up audits client companies at least once each year but may schedule additional visits based on feedback from workers that they place at a client company.<br><br>Requirements -<br><br>General -<br> There is no standardized communication tool across the company, and this causes communication issues between different teams.<br> First up employees must be able to contact each other by using a secure system to ask and answer questions about medical cases.<br> Workers must be able to communicate in near real-time with worker support agents.<br> You must minimize development and administrative effort required to implement the solution.<br><br>Client company visits -<br> Audit team records must be locked after they have been reviewed by a First Up manager. No further edits to the record can be carried out. This must be implemented using standard available system functionality.<br> Audit teams must be able to enter records of their visits to the companies where they have or may place workers. Audit teams must be able to update any necessary records with the latest information.<br> The solution must support tracking of security clearance information for a worker including the date, status, and certifying agency.<br> When a worker makes an appointment, the appointments must appear in the timeline for the workerג€™s contact record.<br><br>Job history information -<br> The solution must provide a worker appointment booking system that can access worker historical job placement data.<br> The solution must allow employees to associate a primary recruiter with each worker. The solution must also allow multiple secondary recruiters to be associated with each worker.<br> Every worker assessment performed must be validated and countersigned by the primary recruiter for a worker.<br> Job posting data from previous work engagements must be accessible by the Power Platform solution to ensure that new job postings are accurate.<br> First Up staff members must be able to view and update worker records. They must be able to see current and historical job placement data on the same form in the new solution.<br><br>Worker access -<br> The solution must support workers that speak different languages.
